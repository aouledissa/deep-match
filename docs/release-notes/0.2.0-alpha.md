# DeepMatch 0.2.0-alpha

Release date: **2026-02-25**

## Highlights

- Introduced a zero-configuration runtime flow driven by generated code:
  - The plugin now generates a module processor object (for example, `AppDeeplinkProcessor`).
  - Clients can call `match(uri)` directly and branch on typed params.
- Added module-level sealed params generation (for example, `AppDeeplinkParams`), with generated
  `*DeeplinkParams` implementing this sealed interface for exhaustive `when` checks.
- Added a composite-build sample app at `samples/android-app` demonstrating:
  - generated processor usage in Compose UI,
  - generated manifest deeplink filters,
  - real-device deeplink validation with `adb`.

## Breaking Changes

- `DeeplinkProcessor` moved from interface-based builder wiring to an open class configured with specs.
- Removed:
  - `DeeplinkHandler`
  - `DeeplinkProcessor.Builder`
  - `DeeplinkProcessorImpl`
- Runtime matching is now return-based:
  - `match(uri: Uri): DeeplinkParams?`

## Migration Summary

- Replace builder setup with the generated module processor object.
- Move deeplink handling logic to caller-side `when` branching.
