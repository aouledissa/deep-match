# DeepMatch 0.3.0-beta

Release date: **Unreleased**

## Highlights

- Added multi-file deeplink spec discovery per module:
    - module root: `.deeplinks.yml` and `*.deeplinks.yml`
    - variant folder: `src/<variant>/.deeplinks.yml` and `src/<variant>/*.deeplinks.yml`
- Added deterministic spec merge precedence:
    - root sources load first
    - variant/build-type sources load second
    - same `name` in later sources overrides earlier definitions
- Added a standalone HTML report (`generateDeeplinkReport`) with:
    - full deeplink catalogue
    - source/module-aware catalogue views
    - interactive URI validator
    - near-miss diagnostics and quick test URIs
- Added plugin report DSL:
    - `deepMatch { report { enabled = true; output = ... } }`

## Behavior Changes

- Duplicate spec names are still invalid within the same YAML source file.
- Across multiple YAML sources, same-name specs now resolve by precedence (later source wins).
- Build-type/variant specs explicitly override module-root specs on same-name collisions.

## Validation Improvements

- `validateDeeplinks` now evaluates merged specs from all discovered sources.
- Composite collision validation remains integrated into variant build/check flow to fail fast on
  URI-shape conflicts across composed modules.

## Docs and Sample

- Added report documentation and task references.
- Updated docs for multi-file discovery and override precedence.
- Expanded sample app with multiple deeplink source files and report generation usage.

## Migration

- See [Migration Guide](../migration-guide-0.3.0-beta.md) for upgrade steps from `0.2.0-alpha`.
